# Getting Started

Singularity Registry provided an automated wahy to build containers from version
controlled recipes in GitHub. Here's how that worked.

 1. [Connect](connect) with GitHub to enable collections to build
 2. [Recipes](recipes) should be named according to tags
 3. [Build](../builds) your recipes via commit, manual, or GitHub deployment
 4. [Interact](naming) with your containers via the Singularity software.


If you previously built a container and want to update your badge to the archive,
you can add the following to your GitHub repository README:

[![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/hosted-singularity--hub-%23e32929.svg]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/hosted-singularity--hub-%23e32929.svg)](https://singularity-hub.org/collections/17) 

```bash
[![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/hosted-singularity--hub-%23e32929.svg]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/hosted-singularity--hub-%23e32929.svg)](https://singularity-hub.org/collections/17) 
```

And don't forget to read about [server limits](../regulatory/limits) thta governed the above.
