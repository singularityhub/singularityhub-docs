# The Last Day of Singularity Hub

The following screenshots were taken on the last day of Singularity Hub being
online, in an effort to preserve its memory. These are out of order, so you
can appreciate as they are.

## Home

Hello Singularity Hub! This was the home page, which was more for show than anything else (it was not very useful).
It sometimes had a message for the users, and links to background about the service.

![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/1Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/1Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub.png)

## About

The about page showed the primary contacts, along with a HUGE thank you to Google for funding
the service. Thank you Google, I <3 you!

## Container Collections

As of summer 2019, users were limited to viewing their own container collection (or searching for others).
This was a view of my (vsoch's) container collections.

![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub.png)

## User Profile

The user profile included a collections tab, user profile, favorites, and "danger zone" to delete an account.

![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(1).png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(1).png)
![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(2).png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(2).png)
![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(3).png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(3).png)
![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(4).png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(4).png)

## Adding a new collection

Adding a new collection was as simple as connecting a GitHub repository!

![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(5).png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(5).png)

## Labels

We kept a complete record of all container labels, which typically were used for versions,
authors, and other container metadata. I always thought this looked like a brick wall.

![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(6).png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(6).png)

## Scientific FileSystem Apps

We did the same for scif (the scientific filesystem) apps, which would turn a container with a single
entrypoint into one with many.

![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(7).png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(7).png)

## Tags

Tags as well, which were derived from GitHub topics associated with the repository. This
was a good way to browse containers.

![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(8).png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(8).png)

## Search

And this was the result of a search! You could search by name, tags, or generally any text field
associated with a container.

![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(9).png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(9).png)

## API

Although the API started with many endpoints to list containers, labels, tags, or anything represented in the database,
ultimately all these extra "fluff" interactions were removed, and only the single required endpoint to pull
and download a container was maintained.

## Collections

My favorite view was always the container collection. It was a simple table of containers to explore!

![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(10).png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(10).png)

## Settings

And each collection had settings where you could change your builder, collection visibility, or manage (e.g., deletion).

![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(11).png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(11).png)
![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(12).png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(12).png)
![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(13).png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(13).png)
![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(14).png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(14).png)

## Usage

The usage section was fairly minimal, but showed you how to pull your container.

![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(15).png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(15).png)

## Recipe

The container recipe not only showed the Singularity recipe, but also metrics related to its build.

![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(16).png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(16).png)


![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub-v2.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub-v2.png)

## Labels

This is an example of labels extracted for this container.

![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(1)-v2.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(1)-v2.png)

## Logs

And the build log would be available on success, or error.

![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(2)-v2.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(2)-v2.png)

## Collection with Topics

This shows a collection with topic tags.

![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(3)-v2.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(3)-v2.png)

## Collection with Multiple Containers

And here is a collection with multiple containers!

![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(4)-v2.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(4)-v2.png)

## Apps

Finally, this shows apps that are associated with a container.

![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(5)-v2.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lastday/Screenshot_2021-04-25 singularity-hub(5)-v2.png)

Thank you to my Singularity Hub robots for being my pretend team, and to Google for funding!
